        <h2>MOPPED</h2>
        <p>
          A moped is a combination of a motorbike and a bicycle, so the earliest
          mopeds were motorbikes which also had bicycle pedals, usually used for
          emergencies. A rare sight on the roads these days, the design feature
          fell out of favor in the 70s, and the laws surrounding mopeds were
          changed in 2013 so older models no longer need to have them. However,
          electric-powered pushbikes have become a more common sight on the
          roads these days, and some of them even look a lot like old-school
          pedaled motorbikes. Even though they can produce the same amount of
          power, they are not classified as mopeds.

        <h2>MOPPED</h2>
        <p>
          Now, a moped is legally defined as a low-powered motorbike with an
          engine capacity of no more than 50cc, and a maximum speed of 48mph.
          They can legally be driven on the road with L plates once you have
          passed CBT training, rather than requiring a full driving licence. Not
          all mopeds are scooters, but the most common type of moped you see on
          the road today is most likely a scooter. However, that doesn't mean
          all scooters are mopeds.
